                <p>After reading the story "Ready Player One", we were tasked with creating an multi-pargraphed, indepth, essay focused around a particular prompt of our choosing. Mine was around my personal opinion the the 80's allusions and whether they detracted from the novel. Take a look!

                <p>For our first ever websites, we read a book titled "The Sound Of Thunder", which would be used as the basis of our fictional "Time Travel Safari Websites". We were required to come up with three responses from the story. Here is the writing and responses!

                <p>For our first venture into JavaScript, we were tasked with creating a "Interactive Story Website". Now...what would we need for this website...a story! So I wrote this outline with a little editing help from partner as our main framework for the game which ended up changing quite a lot but was successfully as interesting as ambitious as I hoped.
