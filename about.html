        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello my name is Austin Dean Sorrell and I am a 17 year old junior from Hollister, California. Welcome to my personal portfolio website.
                As of right now I am currently progressing towards graduating high school and am looking forward to getting into the workforce to enhance my craft with the skills and knowledge I've obtained through my time at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology in Clovis, California. 
                In my spare time, I like getting involved with a variety of different experimental, artistic, and expressive hobbies such as graphic design, video editing, music/sound production, narrative writing, computer linguistics, world building, and calligraphy. 
                My goals for the future all though uncertain and unclear, have an outline.  I know I want to go to a junior college to receive a transition point of higher education. 
                I know I want to go into a field that would highlight and strengthen my weaknesses while detailing the most out of my strengths. But I still as of right now, unsure of what exactly that entails. 
                One thing I am sure of however, is how I am quite obsessive with the ideas of improvement in my everyday life. The satisfaction of displaying improvement through progression and dedication is a large piece in why my hobbies provide so much joy and relaxation to me. 
                A field in which I can see, record, and acknowledge improvement in craft, or in art. Is what I think is ideally where I want to be. 
                Something that would be able to provide a timeline that can be documented to show my growth. 
                If you are interested in what I enjoy doing. I invite you to take a look at my portfolio, resume, and even contact me if you wish. I'm not overtly interesting or anything, but it doesn't hurt to be curious either. 
                Even the most mundane has something special about it.

                <h3>How did you get your start in programming and web-design?</h3>
                <p>The start of my programming career was rough, but not regretful. Our first test of implementing programming skills was through our first independent web design project referred to as our “Chronoshift Websites”. 
                    The mistakes I've learned from the first taste of failure in many aspects, is what made me seek the first taste of success.

                <h3>What was required from you in the project and how did it raise your skill ceiling?</h3>
                    <p>In the “Chronoshift Websites” project, we were tasked with creating a fully functional travel-safari webpage only using HTML 5 and CSS with other limitations in place such as the website not being allowed to have any source of JavaScript. The real challenge being to complete the entire website within the time frame we were given. This project allowed me to implement many skills and habits of mind such as: 

                        Investigate - To dissect and correct complicated issues in my code and solve them efficiently using critical thinking. 
                        
                        Reflect - To note what mistakes I made that created the problem, and learn to avoid it in the future. 
                        
                        Persist - To continue, even when things are difficult and seem bleak.  

                        These habits of mind, in correlation with the knowledge that was gained through the lectures and labs within the class, allowed us to wireframe, design, prototype, and finalize the website in the allotted amount of time. And the reflection afterwards would highlight the bulk of my weaknesses and with guidance allowed me to create a path to strengthen them.

                <h3>How did you acquire your knowledge of HTML 5?</h3>
                    <p>Before my time at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology, I was heavily involved with trying to get into programming in other ways. 
                        I was often too young to understand most of what I was doing, but sites like code.org were foundations that helped lay out the construction for what I would call my current HTML 5 knowledge.
                        It was a lot of trial, error, research, google, and practice. The task of creating a whole website by myself at first seemed daunting. But once I threw myself head first into the frey, I learned quickly and adapted to what I was doing more efficiently. My advice to anyone would be research HTML in your spare time, and when you feel confident enough with your knowledge. 
                        Test yourself by creating a website.
                    </p>

                <h3>How did you acquire your knowledge of CSS?</h3>
                    <p>Similar to how I gained my knowledge of HTML 5. CSS was probably the most difficult part for me to understand. 
                        If I were to explain how I learned CSS skills efficiently I would put it this way as an outline. “HTML 5 is the content, CSS is how you shape that content. 
                        The hardest part of CSS is learning what the limit of what you can do is. Often, I would put a ceiling above myself that would limit my abilities to be creative to my full potential. Surely... I wouldn't be able to make a gradient background.
                        Surely...I won't be able to add animation to the buttons... Etc, etc. But just know if you're skilled enough or eager enough to discover and implement CSS into your webpage, virtually anything you imagine is possible”. 
                        With this principle I created for myself in mind, I've slowly adapted to create more and more ambitious websites. And although many don't come out successfully, that doesn't mean I dont grow from it and become stronger as a result.
                    </p>
            <article class ="cardArticle">
                <h3>How did you acquire your knowledge of JavaScript?</h3>
                    <p>The last thing I learned through my “Web Application Development” journey at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology, was the lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented, script-programming language, known as JavaScript. 
                        JavaScript would be the last piece to my holy trinity of creating an A grade Web Application to truly impress my peers and future employers. 
                        It would be the motor that makes my website function outside the boundaries of regular everyday web pages running on HTML 5 and CSS. But just because I made it this far, doesn't mean it will be a cakewalk. 
                        JavaScript history and its language is in depth, detailed, and can ruin a website if incorrectly coded. The intricacies within how certain elements, functions, properties, objects, variables, and methods can be called. 
                        Is precise in execution. Local and Global scopes, if, if-else, for, or, and switch, statements. Make only a small fraction of what is possible within the language, so there was much to learn. 
                        We spent time mostly working on labs, listening to lectures, creating slideshow presentations, going through the CIW certification course, and reading and attempting all of the labs from with our JavaScript textbook known as “Eloquent JavaScript, 3rd Edition: A Modern Introduction to Programming by Marijn Haverbeke”.
                        The book was very verbose and leaned towards the reader having some resemblance of past knowledge of JavaScript, so if it wasn't thanks to the other things we did in the course, I'm sure it would have been a lot more difficult to understand. 
                        However once learned, the fun, wacky, and overall awesome stuff we were able to do with JavaScript toward the end was insanely cool! Creating our own calculators, animations, text boxes, forms, a button that straight up crashes the page. 
                        Although ridiculous at points, learning to be malleable is definitely a key element in programming and was not a waste of time at all. Learning to even just understand JavaScript, can open up many possibilities in a website.
