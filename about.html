    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello my name is Austin Dean Sorrell and I am a 17 year old junior from Hollister, California. Welcome to my personal portfolio website.

        As of right now I am currently progressing towards graduating high school and am looking forward to getting into the workforce to enhance my craft with the skills and knowledge I've obtained through my time at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology in Clovis, California. 
        
        In my spare time, I like getting involved with a variety of different experimental, artistic, and expressive hobbies such as graphic design, video editing, music/sound production, narrative writing, computer linguistics, world building, and calligraphy. My goals for the future all though uncertain and unclear, have an outline.  I know I want to go to a junior college to receive a transition point of higher education. I know I want to go into a field that would highlight and strengthen my weaknesses while detailing the most out of my strengths. But I still as of right now, unsure of what exactly that entails. One thing I am sure of however, is how I am quite obsessive with the ideas of improvement in my everyday life. The satisfaction of displaying improvement through progression and dedication is a large piece in why my hobbies provide so much joy and relaxation to me. A field in which I can see, record, and acknowledge improvement in craft, or in art. Is what I think is ideally where I want to be. Something that would be able to provide a timeline that can be documented to show my growth. 
        
        If you are interested in what I enjoy doing. I invite you to snoop around my website. I'm not overtly interesting or anything, but it doesn't hurt to be curious either. 
        
        Even something mundane has something special about it.

    <h2>Programming Skills</h2>
    <h3>How did you get your start in programming and web-design?</h3>
    <p>The start of my programming career was rough, but not regretful. Our first test of implementing programming skills was through our first independent web design project referred to as our “Chronoshift Websites”. 
        The mistakes I've learned from the first taste of failure in many aspects, is what made me seek the first taste of success.

    <h4></h4>
    <p>In the “Chronoshift Websites” project, we were tasked with creating a fully functional travel-safari webpage only using HTML 5 and CSS with other limitations in place such as the website not being allowed to have any source of JavaScript. The real challenge being to complete the entire website within the time frame we were given. This project allowed me to implement many skills and habits of mind such as: 

        Investigate - To dissect and correct complicated issues in my code and solve them efficiently using critical thinking. 
        
        Reflect - To note what mistakes I made that created the problem, and learn to avoid it in the future. 
        
        Persist - To continue, even when things are difficult and seem bleak.  
        These habits of mind, in correlation with the knowledge that was gained through the lectures and labs within the class, allowed us to wireframe, design, prototype, and finalize the website in the allotted amount of time. And the reflection afterwards would highlight the bulk of my weaknesses and with guidance allowed me to create a path to strengthen them.
