                    <p>Hello my name is Austin Dean Sorrell and I am a 17 year old junior from Hollister, California. Welcome to my personal portfolio website.
                        As of right now I am currently progressing towards graduating high school, and am looking forward to getting into the workforce. I wish to enhance my craft of web design with the skills and knowledge I've obtained through my time at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology in Clovis, California. 
                        In my spare time, I like getting involved with a variety of different experimental, artistic, and expressive hobbies such as graphic design, video editing, music/sound production, narrative writing, computer linguistics, world building, and calligraphy. 
                        My goals for the future all though uncertain and unclear, have an outline.  I know I want to go to a junior college to receive a transition point of higher education. 
                        I know I want to go into a field that would highlight and strengthen my weaknesses while detailing the most out of my strengths. But I still as of right now, unsure of what exactly that entails. 
                        One thing I am sure of however, is how I am quite obsessive with the ideas of improvement in my everyday life. The satisfaction of displaying improvement through progression and dedication is a large piece in why my hobbies provide so much joy and relaxation to me. 
                        A field in which I can see, record, and acknowledge improvement in craft, or in art. Is what I think is ideally where I want to be. 
                        Something that would be able to provide a timeline that can be documented to show my growth. 
                        If you are interested in what I enjoy doing. I invite you to take a look at my portfolio, resume, and even contact me if you wish. I'm not overtly interesting or anything, but it doesn't hurt to be curious either. 
                        Even the most mundane has something special about it.
